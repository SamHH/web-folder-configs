# dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles targeting a machine running [xmonad](https://xmonad.org) on [Arch](https://archlinux.org). Colour schemes are generated on the fly with [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal).

## Usage

A shell script (`./link.sh`) is included that sets up symlinks for everything. This uses [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) under the hood.

In theory all prerequisite software is captured by the included [pacmanfile](https://github.com/mastertinner/pacmanfile) config.
