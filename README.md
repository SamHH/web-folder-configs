# dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles targeting a machine running xmonad on Arch. Colour schemes are generated on the fly with [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal).

## Usage

A shell script (`./link.sh`) is included that sets up symlinks for everything. This uses Stow under the hood.

In theory all prerequisite software is captured by the included [pacmanfile](https://github.com/mastertinner/pacmanfile) config.
